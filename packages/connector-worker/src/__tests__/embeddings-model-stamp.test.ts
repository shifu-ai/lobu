/**
 * Finding #3 reproducer (part a): embeddings must be version-stamped so a
 * same-dimension model swap can't silently mix incompatible vector spaces.
 *
 * `resolveServiceModel` is the guard that `fetchEmbeddingsFromService` applies
 * to every service response. Asserted directly (pure function) so the check is
 * immune to bun's process-global `mock.module` of '../embeddings.js' in the
 * sibling executor tests.
 *
 *   - a service `model` that differs from the worker's expectation throws
 *     (fail loud) — the exact silent-mixing case, even at equal dimensionality;
 *   - a matching `model` resolves to that stamp;
 *   - an omitted `model` falls back to the worker's expectation.
 *
 * Part (b) — the stamp is mapped onto each streamed event — is asserted in
 * executor-batch-embed.test.ts; persistence onto event_embeddings is asserted
 * server-side in insert-event-embedding-model.test.ts.
