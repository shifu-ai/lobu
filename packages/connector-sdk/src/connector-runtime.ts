 * ConnectorRuntime is the base class for all connectors.

 * - Set `definition` with connector metadata
 * - Implement `sync()` for feed data ingestion

 * have safe defaults (action rejected with `{ success: false, ... }`, auth
 * throws). Connectors that don't declare any `actions` in their definition
 * need not override `execute()`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * class GmailConnector extends ConnectorRuntime {
 *   definition = { key: 'google.gmail', name: 'Gmail', version: '1.0.0', ... };
 *
 *   async sync(ctx: SyncContext): Promise<SyncResult> {

 *     // Create draft, send email, etc.
