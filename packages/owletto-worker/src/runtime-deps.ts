/**
 * Single source of truth for npm packages that connector code may import but
 * which we deliberately do NOT bundle into the compiled connector artifact.
 *
 * These deps must be installed in every runtime that executes compiled
 * connectors — the owletto-backend container that hosts in-process feed sync,
 * and the owletto-worker daemon that runs out-of-process. They appear in:
 *
 *   - `owletto-backend/src/utils/connector-compiler.ts` `external` list
 *     (esbuild leaves the imports as bare specifiers in the bundle)
 *   - `packages/owletto-worker/package.json` dependencies (so the runtime can
 *     resolve them)
 *   - `assertExternalDepsResolvable()` (boot-time check that crashes loud
 *     instead of failing silently per-feed)
 *
 * Rule of thumb: only externalize deps that genuinely can't be bundled —
 * native binaries (`sharp`, `jimp`) or runtime install steps
 * (`playwright` ships browsers via `npx playwright install`). Pure JS deps
 * like `pino` or `link-preview-js` should be bundled instead, even if it
 * costs a few hundred KB per connector — bundling eliminates the entire
 * class of "compiled connector references X but X isn't installed in the
 * worker image" outages.
