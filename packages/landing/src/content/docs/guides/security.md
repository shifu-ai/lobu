description: Isolation, network policy, credentials, and MCP proxy behavior.
---

Lobu is built for multi-user agents: each user or channel gets an isolated worker, while secrets and outbound policy stay on the gateway. A compromised worker should not see raw credentials or reach arbitrary networks.

## Core Model

- **Per-session workers** — each conversation runs in its own subprocess spawned by the gateway. Workspaces and state do not cross sessions; the subprocess can be SIGKILL'd cleanly without taking the gateway down.
- **Gateway is the control plane** — all outbound HTTP, credential resolution, tool policy, and MCP calls route through it.
- **Workers never see real secrets** — provider credentials are replaced with opaque placeholder tokens; the gateway's secret proxy swaps them back before forwarding to upstream APIs.

## Network Isolation

Workers route all outbound HTTP through the gateway's in-process proxy on **127.0.0.1:8118** (`HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8118`). On Linux production hosts the worker spawn is wrapped in `systemd-run --user --scope` with `IPAddressDeny=any` + `IPAddressAllow=127.0.0.1`, which enforces the egress block at the kernel; on macOS dev hosts `HTTP_PROXY` is advisory at the language layer.

Domain access is controlled by env vars:

| Variable | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `WORKER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | unset/empty → no access (default). `*` → unrestricted. Otherwise a comma-separated allowlist. |
| `WORKER_DISALLOWED_DOMAINS` | Blocklist, applied when `WORKER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=*`. |

Domain format: exact (`api.example.com`) or wildcard (`.example.com` matches all subdomains).

### LLM-judged egress

For domains where flat allow/deny is too coarse, like Slack, GitHub user-content, or Notion, skills can route requests through an LLM judge that decides per request. Only domains that match a `judge` rule invoke it, so the cost stays bounded. Skills declare judged domains and named policies in `SKILL.md`; operators layer an `extraPolicy` on top in `lobu.config.ts`.

See [Egress judge](/guides/egress-judge/) for the policy schema, judge defaults (Haiku, verdict cache, fail-closed circuit breaker), and the `egress-decision` audit record.

## Credentials

Workers never receive raw provider credentials or OAuth tokens. The gateway resolves credentials, injects them only at proxy time, and keeps workers on opaque placeholders or agent-scoped proxy URLs. See [Secret proxy](/guides/secret-proxy/) for how the `lobu_secret_<uuid>` placeholder swap works at egress.

| Category | How it works | Where secret material can live |
|---|---|---|
| Provider secrets | Standalone `lobu run` can read from `.env` / `$ENV_VAR` or `secret_ref`. Embedded mode can pass `key` / `secretRef` at startup or resolve credentials dynamically per request. | Built-in Postgres-backed encrypted secret store, external refs such as `secret://...` or `aws-sm://...`, or a host-provided embedded secret store |
| Per-user MCP / OAuth tokens | Collected through device-auth and injected by the gateway MCP proxy per call. Integration auth for GitHub, Google, Linear, and similar services is handled through [Lobu](/getting-started/memory/). | Writable gateway secret store or host-provided embedded secret store |

- **AWS Secrets Manager refs are read-only**. `aws-sm://...` works well for durable provider secret references, but refreshed user tokens still need a writable secret store.
- **Workers never touch third-party OAuth tokens directly**. They call integrations through Lobu MCP tools and the gateway proxy.

For concrete config examples, see the [`lobu.config.ts` reference](/reference/lobu-config/) and the [CLI reference](/reference/cli/).

## MCP Proxy

- Workers discover MCP tools through the gateway and call them with their own JWT token scoped to the agent.
- The proxy enforces **SSRF protection**: upstream MCP URLs that resolve to internal or private IP ranges are blocked.
- **Destructive tool approval**: per the MCP spec, tools without `readOnlyHint: true` or `destructiveHint: false` require user approval in-thread (`Allow once / 1h / 24h / Always / Deny`). The user's choice is recorded in the grant store.
- **Operator override**: the agent `tools` field in `lobu.config.ts` accepts a `preApproved` list of grant patterns (e.g. `/mcp/gmail/tools/list_messages`, `/mcp/linear/tools/*`) that bypass the approval card. This is operator-only — skills cannot set it — so the escape hatch is always visible in code review. See [Tool Policy](/guides/tool-policy/) and the [`lobu.config.ts` reference](/reference/lobu-config/).
