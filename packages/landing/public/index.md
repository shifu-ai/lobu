# Lobu

> Open-source platform for persistent, sandboxed AI agents with shared memory, installable skills, chat integrations, and MCP access. Self-hosted Lobu runs as a single Node process and uses Postgres with pgvector as the only required external service.

## What Lobu does

Lobu runs autonomous agents where your team already works: Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, REST API, and MCP-capable clients. Each agent runs in an isolated worker with gateway-mediated credentials, scoped network egress, and approval flows for sensitive tool calls. Lobu Memory keeps typed entities, decisions, observations, and preferences reusable across conversations and agents.

## Connect any agent to Lobu

The canonical MCP endpoint at [https://lobu.ai/mcp](https://lobu.ai/mcp) lets MCP-capable clients such as Claude, ChatGPT, Claude Code, and OpenClaw sign in once, list available organizations, and switch to the right workspace per conversation. See [/mcp](https://lobu.ai/mcp/) for per-client setup.
