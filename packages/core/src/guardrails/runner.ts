 * trip (others keep running but their results are discarded), or `{tripped: null}`
 * if every guardrail passes. A thrown guardrail is logged and treated as a
 * pass — guardrails must fail closed on their own if they want halt-on-error
 * semantics.
 *
 * The returned outcome includes `ran`, a snapshot of which guardrails had
 * produced a result at the moment the race ended (on first trip, or when all
 * settled). Guardrails still running after short-circuit are intentionally
 * not reflected — they complete in the background and their output is
 * discarded.
