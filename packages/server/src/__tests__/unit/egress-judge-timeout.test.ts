/**
 * Egress-judge per-call timeout + circuit hygiene.
 *
 * The judge is awaited synchronously by the HTTP proxy when a `judge`-action
 * rule matches, so a hung model call would otherwise stall an outbound
 * request indefinitely. These tests pin: (1) a call that hangs past the
 * timeout resolves to a deny verdict within ~timeout, and (2) consecutive
 * timeouts count as breaker failures, so the circuit opens and later calls
 * fail closed without touching the model.
