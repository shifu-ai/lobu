/**
 * Cross-org scoping guard: validateAndScopeQuery MUST reject schema-qualified
 * table references (`public.connections`, `pg_catalog.*`, …) anywhere in the
 * query.
 *
 * Why this is security-critical: org-scoping shadows UNQUALIFIED table names
 * with org-filtered CTEs. A schema-qualified reference resolves to the real
 * base table and bypasses the CTE → reads every org's rows. Regression guard:
 * the @polyglot-sql/sdk migration's first cut used `ast.getTables`, which only
 * returns the first FROM table — a schema-qualified table in a JOIN or subquery
 * slipped past and leaked. These reproducers were RED then; the raw-AST
 * recursion in extractTableRefs makes them GREEN.
