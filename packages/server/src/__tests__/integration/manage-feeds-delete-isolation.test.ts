/**
 * manage_feeds delete_feed — cross-org isolation.
 *
 * Regression: `handleDeleteFeed` cancelled active runs by `feed_id` BEFORE
 * proving the feed belonged to the caller's org (the run-cancel UPDATE is not
 * org-scoped — runs reach their org only through the feed). A guessed foreign
 * feed_id could therefore cancel ANOTHER org's runs even though the org-scoped
 * feed delete then no-ops. The fix deletes the org-owned feed first and bails
 * on no match, so no cross-org side effect happens before the ownership check.
