/**
 * Plan-shape regression guard for the merge redirect (#1788).
 *
 * PR #1788 rewrote the direct entity-link branch from
 *   events.entity_ids @> ARRAY[X]                              (pre-merge)
 * to
 *   events.entity_ids && ARRAY(SELECT id FROM entities WHERE id=X OR merged_into=X)
 *
 * The efficiency claim: the redirect costs ONE extra indexed lookup on
 * idx_entities_merged_into (bounded by how many losers were merged into X), NOT
 * a per-event scan, and the outer `&&` still rides the GIN index
 * idx_events_entity_ids. This test proves that from the actual query PLAN on a
 * non-trivial events table, so a future change that regresses it to a Seq Scan
 * (e.g. an unindexed OR, or a subquery the planner can't inline) fails CI rather
 * than silently shipping a full-table scan on the hottest recall path.
 *
 * Seeds fewer rows than a true perf benchmark (CI-friendly) but enough that the
 * planner prefers the index over a seq scan — the shape, not the wall-clock, is
 * the assertion.
