/**
 * createSyncRun orphan-feed handling (#1012).
 *
 * A feed whose connector resolves to a definition + version row that has no
 * compiled code and no bundled source file (the prod `chrome.tabs` state) can
 * never run. Pre-fix, createSyncRun threw on every CheckDueFeeds tick, storming
 * the logs with a per-poll error and never making progress. It must instead
 * soft-delete the orphan feed (mirroring the no-definition path) so it stops
 * appearing in CheckDueFeeds.
