/**
 * Internal smoke-test dispatch endpoint.
 *
 * POST /api/internal/smoke/dispatch
 *
 * Inserts a synthetic chat_message run into `public.runs`. The runs-queue
 * MessageConsumer (running in the same app pod) claims it, spawns the
 * worker subprocess, the worker runs end-to-end, and on terminal cleanup
 * writes a row to `agent_transcript_snapshot`. The Helm post-upgrade
 * smoke-test Job polls that row to gate the release: if the snapshot
 * doesn't materialize with `terminal_status='completed'` within the
 * configured window, Helm rolls the release back.
 *
 * Why a dedicated endpoint and not "just call the public chat API":
 *   - The public Agent API requires an OAuth bearer / PAT from a real
 *     authenticated user — we can't easily mint one from inside a Helm
 *     post-upgrade Job without per-cluster bootstrap.
 *   - Real chat connections (Telegram/Slack) require platform-side
 *     secrets and webhook configuration that an in-cluster smoke Job
 *     shouldn't carry.
 *   - The path under test is the worker spawn + run completion pipeline,
 *     not the platform ingress. Synthesising the message directly into
 *     the runs queue exercises everything from MessageConsumer onward,
 *     which is exactly the surface that has been silently broken across
 *     the recent regressions (Phase 5 env flip, runs denormalize/revert,
 *     JobEventSchema, action_input JSONB shape).
 *
 * Auth model (four layers — all must pass):
 *   1. Bearer token equal to `process.env.SMOKE_TEST_TOKEN`
 *      (constant-time compare). The token is loaded into the deployment
 *      Secret and into the smoke-test Job's envFrom; ingress doesn't
 *      proxy it.
 *   2. The request MUST NOT carry any `x-forwarded-*` / `forwarded` /
 *      `x-real-ip` header. A standards-compliant reverse proxy or
 *      ingress controller (nginx, istio, traefik, etc.) adds at least
 *      one of these; the in-cluster smoke Job hits the
 *      `<release>-app` Service via cluster DNS, which never traverses
 *      ingress, so the headers are absent on legitimate calls.
 *   3. The Host header MUST start with the in-cluster app service
 *      hostname (`<release>-lobu-app`) — set explicitly by the smoke
 *      Job's curl URL. Public ingress traffic always carries the
 *      operator's external hostname (e.g. `app.lobu.ai`) in Host, so
 *      this rejects requests routed through ingress even if (2) is
 *      somehow bypassed by a non-compliant proxy. The required Host
 *      prefix is operator-configurable via `SMOKE_TEST_ALLOWED_HOST`
 *      env (defaults to "" — empty means "any Host accepted", which is
 *      only safe when (2) is honoured; operators are encouraged to set
 *      this).
 *   4. If `SMOKE_TEST_TOKEN` / `SMOKE_TEST_AGENT_ID` / `SMOKE_TEST_ORG_ID`
 *      are unset OR empty the endpoint returns 503 so the check fails
 *      closed: a deployment with partial configuration will fail its
 *      smoke gate.
 *
 * Isolation guarantees (server-pinned, not client-supplied):
 *   - The synthetic agent + organization identifiers come from
 *     `process.env.SMOKE_TEST_AGENT_ID` and `process.env.SMOKE_TEST_ORG_ID`
 *     — caller-supplied values are ignored. This makes it structurally
 *     impossible for a leaked token to trigger runs on a real tenant's
 *     agent: even with the token, the caller can only dispatch against
 *     the env-configured smoke namespace.
 *   - The conversationId is caller-supplied so each release gets a unique
 *     run id, but must carry the configured `smoke-` prefix.
 *   - The chat_message row is tagged with `idempotency_key=
 *     smoke:<conversationId>` so repeated calls within a deployment do
 *     not flood the queue.
 *
 * The actual snapshot poll lives in the smoke-test Job's shell loop
 * (charts/lobu/templates/smoke-test-job.yaml) — keeping the polling out
 * of this handler avoids tying up a Hono request for the full timeout
 * window.
