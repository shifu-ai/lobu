/**
 * SseManager — owns per-agent Server-Sent Events fan-out.
 *
 * Extracted from `routes/public/agent.ts` so the route handler doesn't have
 * to track in-memory connection maps, TTL-pruned backlogs, and dead-connection
 * sweeps inline. A single instance is created in `core-services.ts` and
 * injected into the agent route and into any component that broadcasts
 * into SSE streams (API platform, response renderer, unified thread
 * consumer).
 *
 * Behavior notes:
 *  - Two backlog rings per agentId, both capped at `backlogLimit` most-recent
 *    entries and TTL-pruned lazily on every read AND write: one for stream
 *    events (`output`/`status`, high-volume, evict freely) and one for
 *    everything else (interaction cards, terminal `complete`/`error`). The
 *    split keeps a chatty turn's deltas from evicting an ask_user card before
 *    the client can reconnect and replay it.
 *  - `broadcast` writes to every live connection; a connection is treated as
 *    dead when it reports `closed`/`destroyed`/`writableEnded` OR when a
 *    write throws — dead connections are removed silently (no throw, no log).
 *  - Backlog is ALWAYS remembered (even when no connections are attached) so
 *    a late subscriber can replay recent events.
 *  - Cross-replica: `broadcast` also hands the event to the injected
 *    `SseFanoutPublisher` (see `sse-fanout.ts`), and peer events arrive via
 *    `deliverFromPeer`, which seeds the backlog too — so a client whose SSE
 *    lands on (or fails over to) any pod can replay events produced on
 *    another. Best-effort transport; durable terminal delivery stays on the
 *    thread_response owner-gate in `unified-thread-consumer.ts`.
