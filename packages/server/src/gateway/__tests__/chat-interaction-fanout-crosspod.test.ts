/**
 * Cross-pod fan-out for CHAT-PLATFORM interaction cards — the most faithful
 * single-process seam test of the multi-replica delivery path.
 *
 * The production bug: a worker posts an `ask_user`/approval/link-button card
 * into ITS pod's `InteractionService`, but under N>1 replicas (Slack webhooks
 * don't pin to the connection's pod) that pod rarely owns the connection's
 * in-process interaction bridge — so the card was silently lost.
 *
 * This test stands up BOTH sides of the seam in one process:
 *
 *   - COLD replica: a real `InteractionService` with the real fan-out producer
 *     (`registerChatInteractionFanout`) wired as NOT-warm-locally, so a posted
 *     card is enqueued onto the (stubbed) `thread_response` queue instead of
 *     rendered locally — exactly what the worker's pod does.
 *
 *   - WARM replica: a real `InteractionService` with the REAL interaction
 *     bridge (`registerInteractionBridge`) registered for the connection, plus a
 *     real `UnifiedThreadResponseConsumer` whose `ensureDeliverable` returns
 *     true (this replica owns the connection). The consumer claims the enqueued
 *     row and re-emits the card onto the warm `InteractionService`, which the
 *     real bridge renders.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COVERS (real, not mocked):
 *   - real fan-out producer + envelope construction
 *   - real consumer branch (`handleChatInteraction`) incl. connectionId guard
 *   - the REAL `registerInteractionBridge` rendering path: it writes a real
 *     `pending_interactions` row (real Postgres) and posts exactly one card
 *   - the bridge's per-connection `handledEvents` dedup across a queue re-claim
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER (still owed):
 *   - the Postgres `thread_response` queue itself (single-claim/SKIP-LOCKED,
 *     re-queue-on-throw) — stubbed here; verified by the queue's own tests
 *   - two genuinely separate OS processes/pods and ClientIP affinity
 *   - the real Chat SDK platform post to Slack (the `thread.post` is a mock)
 *
 * A live two-pod e2e (or a post-deploy live Slack `ask_user` round-trip) is
 * still the owed hard gate per AGENTS.md.
