/**
 * Integration tests for the `acquireConversationLock` reserved-connection
 * cap added in PR #870 (Fix 2). Bound the number of pinned
 * `sql.reserve()` connections per gateway process via
 * `LOBU_MAX_RESERVED_LOCKS` (default derived from `DB_POOL_MAX`) and
 * expose an in-process counter so an operator can observe how close the
 * gateway is to exhausting the postgres-js pool with per-conversation
 * reservations.
 *
 * Validated against the embedded Postgres gateway test harness.
