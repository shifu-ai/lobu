 * Egress judge: wraps a JudgeClient with a per-policy verdict cache and

 * request.

 * Thread-safety: single-threaded Node event loop; no locks needed. The
 * in-flight dedup map (owned by {@link JudgeRunner}) coalesces concurrent
 * judge calls for the same cache key so a burst of identical requests costs
 * exactly one API call.
