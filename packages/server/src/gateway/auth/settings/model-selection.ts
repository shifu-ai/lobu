 * the single point every dispatch lane (direct API, Listen bridge,
 * chat-instance, watcher HTTP, scheduled-job direct enqueue) converges on
 * before a worker runs.
 *
 * Decision B semantics — NO org-default escalation:
 *   - `allowedRefs === null` (allow-all) ⇒ the requested model passes unchanged
 *     (but an `__unresolved__` sentinel is never a real model → dropped).
 *   - `allowedRefs === []` (deny-all — e.g. a not-found agent) ⇒ nothing
 *     qualifies, so any requested model is dropped (fail closed).
 *   - requested ref is EXACTLY in the list ⇒ passes unchanged, PROVIDED it is
 *     routable (when a routability predicate is supplied); an exact-but-
 *     unroutable ref is replaced with the first routable listed ref (fail
 *     closed if none), never sent dead to the worker.
 *   - requested ref is NOT in the list ⇒ replaced with the first LISTED ref that
 *     is non-sentinel AND routable. If none qualifies (all sentinels /
 *     none routable), the model is dropped (undefined) so the run FAILS CLOSED —
 *     it never escalates to an unlisted model.
 *
 * Returns the effective model ref, or undefined to run with no model (fail
 * closed / auto-detect for the allow-all case).
