/**
 * Regression guard for the gateway boot wiring of the HTTP egress proxy.
 *
 * The proxy READS per-agent grants + judged-domain policy from module-level
 * stores that must be injected at boot (`setProxyGrantStore` /
 * `setProxyPolicyStore`). #672's dead-code sweep deleted those two boot calls
 * (it kept `startFilteringProxy()`), so at runtime the proxy silently skipped
 * grants and never consulted the egress judge — only the global
 * `WORKER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` allowlist stayed in force. Every proxy test injects
 * the stores itself, so nothing covered the boot path and the regression shipped.
 *
 * `wireProxyEgressStores` is the extracted boot step. These tests prove, in the
 * red→green sense, that:
 *   - WITHOUT it, a per-agent grant / judged-domain rule has no effect (the
 *     exact regression behavior); and
 *   - WITH it, the grant is honored and the judged domain reaches the judge.
