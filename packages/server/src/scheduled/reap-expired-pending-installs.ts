/**
 * Expired unclaimed-Slack-install reaper.
 *
 * A Slack-initiated install (marketplace / raw "Add to Slack") lands at the
 * OAuth callback with a bot token but no Lobu org, so it's parked as an org-less
 * `pending` `app_installations` row and the installer is DMed a single-use claim
 * link (Phases 1-3 on this branch). If nobody ever claims it, that row keeps a
 * live bot token encrypted in its metadata forever. This reaper reaps pending
 * rows older than a TTL (default 7 days): best-effort `auth.revoke` of the bot
 * token so an abandoned workspace's credential is invalidated, then delete the
 * row.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately tight — provider='slack', provider_app_id='cloud',
 * status='pending' — so an active install (or any other provider's row) is NEVER
 * touched. The DELETE re-asserts every one of those predicates so a row claimed
 * (status flipped to 'active' + org bound) between scan and delete is left alone.
 *
 * Single-claimant per tick via the runs-queue (like the other scheduled jobs);
 * pure Postgres, so it's correct under N>1 app replicas. The DELETE is the
 * authoritative claim: revocation runs only over the rows THIS caller actually
 * removed (RETURNING), so two overlapping runners never both revoke the same
 * token, and the token never outlives its row.
