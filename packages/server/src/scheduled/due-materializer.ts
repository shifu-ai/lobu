/**
 * Generic "materialize due items into runs" loop.
 *
 * Three schedulers share the same shape — scan for due rows (each query
 * carries its own status filters / NOT EXISTS active-run dedup / LIMIT),
 * then create one run per row, counting created vs skipped and isolating
 * per-item failures so one bad row can't abort the batch:
 *
 *   - scheduled/check-due-feeds.ts        → sync runs for due feeds
 *   - watchers/automation.ts              → watcher runs for due watchers
 *   - scheduled/trigger-embed-backfill.ts → embed_backfill runs per org batch
 *
 * The SQL stays entirely in each caller's `fetchDue` / `createRun` callbacks;
 * this module only owns the orchestration (empty short-circuit, loop,
 * counters, per-item error isolation).
