/**
 * Managed-connector connection-token endpoint.
 *
 * Public-org managed connectors: a managed connector lives in a PUBLIC org
 * (`organization.visibility = 'public'`) with a managed `oauth_app`. A user
 * JOINS that org (a `member` row) and CONNECTS normally — consent against the
 * managed app mints a connection OWNED by them (`connections.created_by`). The
 * managed client secret + refresh token stay in the cloud and never leave it.
 *
 * At RUNTIME the user's LOCAL Lobu instance fetches a fresh ACCESS token for
 * its own user's connection via this endpoint, authenticating with any valid
 * bearer carrying the `connections:token` scope — in practice the user's own
 * `lobu login` OAuth access token (verified via `provider.verifyAccessToken`),
 * or an explicitly-scoped PAT. The token is resolved/refreshed server-side via
 * the existing `CredentialService` (`resolveExecutionAuth`) and ONLY the access
 * token + expiry are returned — never the refresh token or client secret.
 *
 * Owner-scoped: the lookup is keyed on `created_by = <authed user>`, so a user
 * can only fetch tokens for connections they own.
 *
 * Endpoint (bearer with `connections:token` scope):
 *   - POST /oauth/connection-token  { org, connector_key }

// auth/oauth/scopes single source of truth. Deliberately separate from the
// default `mcp:*` scopes so a broad org-member credential cannot mint connection
// tokens. Two credential shapes carry it:
//   - a USER's device-login access token (`lobu login`) — which requests the
//     scope EXPLICITLY (auth/oauth/scopes.ts); the default path for the local
//     instance's managed-connector resolver.
//   - a PAT minted EXPLICITLY with `--scope connections:token` (the headless /
//     CI fallback, `LOBU_CLOUD_PAT`).
// A default `mcp:read mcp:write` member PAT is NOT enough — the gate stays
// meaningful against a broad CI PAT.

 * Auth for the connection-token endpoint. Accepts ANY valid bearer
 * (`verifyAccessToken` handles both OAuth 2.1 login tokens and `owl_pat_*`
 * PATs), then requires:
 *   - the token to be bound to an organization (null-org → 401), and
 *   - the `connections:token` scope (403 otherwise), before any org/connection
 *     lookup.
 * The resolved user is stashed on the context for the handler's owner-scoped
 * lookup; the handler verifies membership of the BODY's `org` explicitly.
