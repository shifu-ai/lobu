/**
 * Guard against creating an UNBOUND `app_installation` connection.
 *
 * When a connector's primary auth method is `app_installation` (e.g. github),
 * a connection bound to an install is created by the App install callback's
 * `linkGithubAppInstallation`, which stamps `config.installation_ref`. The guard
 * rejects a create/connect that would resolve to `app_installation` auth with no
 * `installation_ref` — a dead, unbound connection — and points the user at the
 * install flow.
 *
 * SELECTION-AWARE: it must NOT block a connection that resolves to a DIFFERENT
 * auth method. github also declares oauth + env_keys, so a legit create/connect
 * that supplies an auth profile slug, env/PAT creds in config, or a managedBy
 * grant uses one of those methods — the guard skips entirely. Only when no such
 * intent is present (and there is no installation_ref) does the connection fall
 * through to the app_installation primary, which is what we reject.
 *
 * RESOLVED, NOT ASSERTED: a passed `auth_profile_slug` / `app_auth_profile_slug`
 * only satisfies the guard when it RESOLVES to a real auth profile for this
 * org/connector (same resolver the create/connect flow uses). A non-existent or
 * non-resolvable slug is treated as if no slug was provided — otherwise a caller
 * could assert a bogus slug to bypass the guard and create a dead, unbound
 * app_installation connection.
 *
 * Connector-agnostic: keys on the resolved auth method type (not on `github`),
 * so it covers any future app_installation connector.
