/**
 * The chat channel visibility gate — "which channels may THIS requester read?"
 *
 * Reads the `member_of` edges the chat ACL sync materializes (via the generic
 * access-graph engine): a requester may recall a channel's transcript iff their
 * `$member` entity is
 * `member_of` that channel. This is the two-sided, fail-closed gate from the
 * authz program (docs/plans/authz-acl-permission-program.md §4) applied to chat
 * recall: the existing per-agent channel fence is one side (the agent only sees
 * its bound channels); this is the other (the user only sees channels they
 * belong to). The two INTERSECT — an agent acting for a user never widens past
 * either bound.
 *
 * Enforcement is per-connection and OFF by default: a connection's rows are
 * gated only once it has a fresh `authz_source_acl_state` row (`acl_support
 * = 'full'` AND `freshness_state = 'fresh'`). A connection that was NEVER graphed
 * (no `authz_source_acl_state` row) keeps the existing per-agent behavior, so an
 * absent graph never silently hides a channel. But once a row exists, anything
 * short of full+fresh — partial/none support, stale/failed freshness, or a fresh
 * row aged past the window — fails CLOSED rather than passing through, so a
 * half-built or stalled graph can never mis-enforce.
 *
 * Fail-closed: for an ENFORCED connection, a channel is dropped unless the
 * requester is provably a member. An unresolved requester (anonymous/headless,
 * or no `$member` in this org) sees NONE of an enforced connection's channels.
