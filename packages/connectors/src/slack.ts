/**
 * Slack (catalog connector — declaration only)
 *
 * Slack is a CHAT platform, not a data feed: inbound traffic is Chat SDK events
 * delivered to the shared app-webhook endpoint, and per-message routing is via
 * `/lobu link` channel bindings — NOT a connector `sync()`. This file exists so
 * the Slack app's credentials + install/webhook scheme flow through the SAME
 * declaration-driven resolver as GitHub/Jira/Linear: the gateway reads the
 * declared env-var NAMES here (`SLACK_CLIENT_ID`, `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`,
 * `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`) instead of hardcoding `process.env.SLACK_*` literals.
 *
 * Declared as `kind: 'integration'` (see {@link IntegrationConnector}): a pure
 * app/auth declaration, deliberately INERT as a catalog entry (see the
 * bundled-connector side-effect audit):
 *  - NO `feeds` → no auto-provisioned data feeds, nothing for device-reconcile
 *    to wire, and the install callback writes only the `app_installations` row.
 *  - NO `runtime` / `requiredCapability` → `getBundledDeviceConnectors()` filters
 *    it out, so it is never auto-installed onto a device fleet.
 *  - NO `sync()` → an integration connector has no syncable feeds; the
 *    `IntegrationConnector` base throws if one is ever scheduled (a wiring bug).
 *
 * The webhook `delivery: 'app_installation'` + `routingKeyPaths` tells the
 * app-webhook router this connector's deliveries route by Slack `team_id` through
 * `/api/v1/app-webhooks/slack`. Verify is FULLY DECLARATIVE — the generic engine
 * computes Slack's `v0:{ts}:{rawBody}` HMAC straight from this schema; there is no
 * Slack-specific verify plugin.
