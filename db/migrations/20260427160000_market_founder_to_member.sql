-- migrate:up

-- Migrate `founder` entities in the `market` org to `$member` entities so
-- the identity engine can adopt them on OAuth sign-in.
--
-- Rationale: the engine binds a signing-in user to an existing `$member` by
-- multi-namespace identity lookup (email, linkedin_url, github_username,
-- etc.). Pre-curated founders need to BE `$member` rows for that adoption
-- to fire. Keeping `founder` as a separate type means the engine can never
-- bind a user to their pre-curated profile.
--
-- The post-migration shape:
--   - `$member` entities in market carry the founder's metadata, including
--     `metadata.role='founder'` so the public browse route in
--     `lobu-ai/owletto-web` can filter `$member` rows on role.
--   - `entity_identities` rows are written for every namespace value the
--     migration can extract (email, linkedin_url, twitter_handle).
--   - Existing relationship rows (`works_at`, `founded`, `previously_at`,
--     `educated_at`, etc.) are re-pointed from founder.id to the new
--     $member.id.
--   - Relationship-type rules are widened to accept `$member` as the
--     source slug for the relationships that pointed at founders.
--   - Source `founder` rows are soft-deleted (deleted_at=NOW()) — kept for
--     audit history; the application path filters them out.
--
-- Idempotent: each step uses ON CONFLICT / WHERE NOT EXISTS, so a re-run
-- on a partially-migrated DB completes the unfinished work without
-- duplicating rows. Safe to run on a fresh DB (no founders yet) — every
-- query returns the empty set.
